/** @brief Game Management / Helper Module
 *
 * @defgroup game Game Management / Helper Module
 *
 * This module helps manage multiple game modules running on a single system as
 * well as implementing several helper functions and structures.
 *
 * Command list:
 * - $game help (print help info)
 * - $game player1 {name} [color] [skill] (set player1's name [optional color and skill])
 * - $game player2 {name} [color] [skill] (set player2's name [optional color and skill])
 * name can be up to 15 characters, color can be red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan
 * white, skill can be 0 to 9.
 * - $game {game_name} play (play game_name)
 * - $game {game_name} help (show help for game_name)
 * - $game {game_name} score (show highscores for game_name)
 * - $game {game_name} var1 var2... (call callback for game_name with argc, argv)
 * this can be used to implement changing settings or other more advanced
 * features that are not supported by default.
 *
 * Notes for developing a game using this game management module:
 * - Create a function to initiate playing the game (i.e. Play()). The Play
 * function will typically initialize the states, score, screen, etc. then
 * register a receiver using Game_RegisterPlayer1Receiver() or
 * Game_RegisterPlayer2Receiver() and it can shedule tasks to run the game etc.
 * When the game is over you should be sure to ungregister the receiver and
 * remove any tasks you still have scheduled.
 * - Create a function to print instructions and other information about your game (i.e. Help())
 * - If you use generic names like Play() or Help() or anything else that someone
 * else might use then declare the function to be static so it is limited in
 * scope to your game file "static void Play(void);"
 * - Create a [game_name]_Init() function which in most cases will be your only
 * public function and should be called from main,
 * - [game_name]_Init() should at a minimum call Game_Register() and can optionally
 * call Game_RegisterCallback() and/or Game_RegisterHighscoreCallback().
 *
 * @author Michael Muhlbaier
 * @todo MM add "$game player1 ..." and "$game player2 ..." command support
 * @todo MM implement transparent character support
